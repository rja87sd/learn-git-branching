        Week 7 Day 4 Assignment | Git Rebase
    </h1>

    <main>
        <h2>Step 1: Create a Feature Branch (Local):</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>On your local learn-git-branching repository, create and switch to a new branch named feature-branch.</li>
            <li>Make some changes in a file within feature-branch but do not commit them.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h2>Step 2: Simulate Main Branch Updates (Local and Remote):</h2>

        Locally, switch to the main branch and make different changes. Commit these changes.
        On GitHub, navigate to the same repository and make additional changes to the main branch. Commit these changes
        directly
        on GitHub.
        Screenshot: Capture the GitHub commit as proof of making remote changes.
        Step 3: Stash and Rebase (Local):

        Switch back to feature-branch locally and stash your changes using git stash.
        Perform a rebase by executing git rebase main.
        Resolve any conflicts that arise, then continue with git rebase --continue.
        Screenshot: Take a screenshot showing the successful rebase completion and conflict resolution.
        Step 4: Apply Stashed Changes (Local):

        Apply your stashed changes with git stash pop.
        Resolve any conflicts and make a new commit.
        Screenshot: Capture the final commit in feature-branch showing the application of stashed changes.
        Part 2: Pulling with Rebase Configuration
        Step 5: Configure Pull Behavior (Local):

        Set your local Git to merge by default during pulls with git config pull.rebase false.
        Step 6: Create Diverged Changes (Local and Remote):

        Locally, on the main branch, make and commit some changes.
        On GitHub, add different changes to the main branch and commit them.
        Screenshot: Take a screenshot of the GitHub interface showing these remote commits.
        Step 7: Pull and Merge Changes (Local):

        Locally, execute git pull on the main branch.
        If a merge conflict occurs, resolve it and complete the merge.
        Screenshot: Capture the terminal showing the successful pull and merge, including conflict resolution if
        applicable.
        Part 3: Documentation and Submission
        Compile Documentation:

        Update the README.md in your learn-git-branching repository.
        Include step-by-step descriptions of your actions for both parts of the assignment. Indicate clearly whether
        each action
        was performed locally or on GitHub.
        Insert the screenshots at the appropriate steps to visually demonstrate your process.
        Reflect on Learning:

        Write a brief reflection on how these exercises have improved your understanding of managing branches,
        conflicts, and
        diverged changes in Git.
        Push and Submit:

        Push your updated README.md with the documentation and screenshots to GitHub.
        Submit the URL of your learn-git-branching repository.
