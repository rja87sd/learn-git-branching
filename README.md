- Section 1 covered the basic commands of commit and branch, which commit changes made or make an entirely new branch, respectively.
- Section 2 covered navigationg through the different commits in a branch or moving between branches.
- Section 3 covered cherry picking and interactive rebase, which allow the dev to select specific commits to push to the main branch in a neat manner.

- A Mixed Bag: This section was the most difficult for me, as I was still somewhat unfamiliar with the syntax and the commands for git. But with some trial and error, and assistance from the instructor, I was able to grasp the concept of grabbing only 1 commit through the command line.
- Advanced Topics: This one was a lot of fun. Once I got the hang of how it works, I was able to cherry-pick the required commits and rebase them to each branch without issue.
