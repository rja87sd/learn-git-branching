- Section 1 covered the basic commands of commit and branch, which commit changes made or make an entirely new branch, respectively.
- Section 2 covered navigationg through the different commits in a branch or moving between branches.
- Section 3 covered cherry picking and interactive rebase, which allow the dev to select specific commits to push to the main branch in a neat manner.

- A Mixed Bag: This section was the most difficult for me, as I was still somewhat unfamiliar with the syntax and the commands for git. But with some trial and error, and assistance from the instructor, I was able to grasp the concept of grabbing only 1 commit through the command line.
- Advanced Topics: This one was a lot of fun. Once I got the hang of how it works, I was able to cherry-pick the required commits and rebase them to each branch without issue.

- Push & Pull: This section was fairly straightforward. It covered the basics of the push & pull commands, retrieving and adding data to the main branch.
- To Origin and Beyond: This section game me the most trouble out of the entire game. It covered much more advanced topics such as pushing and pulling remotely while not checked out on the main branch, resetting a commit when push was denied, etc. I had to repeat each level at least once, but luckily was able to finish them.
